        It's no secret that creating single-page JavaScript applications can be pretty challenging these days.
        Fortunately, there are some projects available which simplify things and help you build apps faster. Create
        React App is a very good example of that. Even still, there's a high learning curve before you can build a
        proper application. That's because you need to learn about client-side routing, page layout, and so on. If you'd
        like to perform server-side rendering for faster page loads, things can become even more difficult. So, we need
        something simple but customizable. Think about how webapps are created with PHP. You create some files, write
        PHP code, then simply deploy it. We don't have to worry about routing much, and the app is rendered on the
        server by default.
